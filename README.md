# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

My motivation came from my desire to learn coding and build a career path from it.
I built this project to show that I have learned and absorbed the information given to me through the prework requirement from the UCLA coding bootcamp.
It solves my lack of education in coding, as well as helps me to achieve a foothold in starting my career in coding.
I learned how to create a webpage using HTML, style it using CSS, and give it structure with JavaScript.
